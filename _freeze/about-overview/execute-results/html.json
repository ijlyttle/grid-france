To be clear, this approach is a lot of fun, but it makes writing up the efforts more challenging (no doubt, reading it also becomes more challenging).\n\nIn short, this data-engineering pipeline:\n\n-   is run by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) on a daily basis\n-   compiles data offered by the [RTE-France](https://data.rte-france.com/catalog/) (electricity grid) API\n-   publishes the pipeline as a website\n-   offers parquet files that can be imported into other applications\n\nIt uses a series of tools:\n\n-   [DVC](https://dvc.org/), data version-control:\n\n    -   manages versions of large data files on remote storage (S3, Blob Storage, etc.), separate from git\n    -   lets you specify the dependencies within the pipeline, e.g. which Quarto files to render\n    -   lets you specify parameters, which also can be used as as dependencies\n\n-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), technical publishing:\n\n    -   compiles a series of `.qmd` files - similar in form to `.ipynb` files - into an HTML site\n    -   `.qmd` files contain Markdown for prose, and Python blocks as code, run using a Jupyter kernel\n    -   this site includes the parquet files published from the pipeline\n\n-   [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/), data-frame processing:\n\n    -    within the `.qmd` files, trying this out as an alternative to Pandas\n\n-   [Observable](https://observablehq.com/), data framework:\n\n    -   although not part of this pipeline, an Observable notebook can import the published parquet files into DuckDB, for further querying and visualization.\n\n**Note**: I am not trained as a data engineer; I offer my deepest apologies to my properly-trained colleagues.\n\n## Data pipeline flow\n\nThis flowchart is generated using DVC:\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n\tnode1[\"flow-ingest\"]\n\tnode2[\"flow-publish\"]\n\tnode3[\"flow-transform\"]\n\tnode4[\"generation-ingest\"]\n\tnode5[\"generation-publish\"]\n\tnode6[\"generation-transform\"]\n\tnode7[\"index\"]\n\tnode1-->node3\n\tnode2-->node7\n\tnode3-->node2\n\tnode4-->node6\n\tnode5-->node7\n\tnode6-->node5\n\n```\n\n\n",
